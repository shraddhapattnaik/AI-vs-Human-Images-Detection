# AI vs Human Images Detection

This repository presents an AI image detection system that differentiates between human and AI-generated images using the InceptionV3 architecture. Our approach is built on Kaggle dataset that pairs authentic images sampled from Shutterstock with their state-of-the-art generative model counterparts.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of authentic images collected from the Shutterstock platform. Key characteristics include:

- **Diverse Categories:** Images are sampled across various categories.
- **Balanced Human Representation:** Approximately one-third of the images feature humans, ensuring a balanced representation.
- **Structured Pairing:** Each authentic image is paired with an equivalent AI-generated image. This direct pairing enables clear, comparative analysis between real and generated content.
- **Robust for Evaluation:** The structured dataset allows for rigorous evaluation and development of image authenticity detection systems.

## Model and Experimentation

We utilized the **InceptionV3** model to differentiate between the authentic and AI-generated images. After fine-tuning on our dataset, our model achieved the following performance:

- **Final Accuracy:** 91.32%
- **Final Loss:** 0.2185

These metrics indicate that the model has a robust capability in distinguishing authentic images from those generated by advanced generative models.
